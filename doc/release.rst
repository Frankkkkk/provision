Release Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two named releases and many sematic versioned releases.

* tip - This is the currently built master code.  It follows the bleeding edge of the trees.
* stable - This is the default release used by install.  It follows to most recently released code.

The other releases follow the v<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch> format.  e.g. v3.0.0

The :ref:`rs_install` process will default to **stable** but can be modified to use other releases.

Docs are also generated for these as well.

The full version string generated by the build tool looks like this:

# v3.0.0-tip-galthaus-dev-19-d012b1d6ba892c96c81c24ee93b668591663ca5c
# v3.0.0-tip-16-e1fa235dc28f7d278bc34a0d4db87c306d9d3ba8
# v3.0.0-0-821108c416dfc1486919baa52dae284975d2ad8b

The base form is base semver tag, extra pieces, gits ahead of that base, and the actual git commit checksum.

The extra pieces is either -tip to indicate that the build comes from the tip of the tree or
-tip-<username>-dev where the username is who built the custom build that is ahead of tip at the time.
