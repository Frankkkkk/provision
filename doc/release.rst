Release Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two named releases and many sematic versioned releases.

* tip - This is the currently built master code.  It follows the bleeding edge of the trees.
* stable - This is the default release used by install.  It follows to most recently released code.

The other releases follow the v<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch> format.  e.g. v3.0.0

The :ref:`rs_install` process will default to **stable** but can be modified to use other releases.

Docs are also generated for these as well.
