Developer Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the following steps can be rolled up into the following quickstart.

  ::

    mkdir rocket-skates-dev
    cd rocket-skates-dev
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rackn/rocket-skates/master/tools/build.sh | bash

Or use the manual steps below.

We are using go version 1.8 or better.

We are using `go-bindata <https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata>`_ to embed binary assets in *rocket-skates*  You can obtain it by running `go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...`, which will leave the `go-bindata` executable in `$GOPATH/bin`

We are using `go-swagger <https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger>`_ to generate code from the API specification file.  You can obtain it by running `go get -u github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger`, which will leave the `swagger` executabe in `$GOPATH/bin`

We are using `swagger-ui <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui>`_ for a quick UI to inspect the API and drive the system.  It is customizable if we need, but we are running it straight up for now.

This basic dist files have been embedded into the rocket skates binary for the time being.  These are copied from the swagger-ui tree.

*NOTES* on how to get swagger-ui

* git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui
* cp -r swagger-ui/dist/\* embedded/assets/swagger-ui
