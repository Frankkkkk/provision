drpcli reservations list
========================

List all reservations

Synopsis
--------

This will list all reservations by default. You can narrow down the
items returned using index filters. Use the "indexes" command to get the
indexes available for reservations.

To filter by indexes, you can use the following stanzas:

-   Eq This will return items Equal to according to
-   Ne This will return items Not Equal to according to
-   Lt This will return items Less Than according to
-   Lte This will return items Less Than Or Equal to according to
-   Gt This will return items Greater Than according to
-   Gte This will return items Greater Than Or Equal to according to
-   Between This will return items Greater Than Or Equal to and Less
   Than Or Equal to according to
-   Except This will return items Less Than or Greater Than according to

You can chain any number of filters together, and they will pipeline
into each other as appropriate. After the above filters have been
applied, you can further tweak how the results are returned using the
following meta-filters:

-  'reverse' to return items in reverse order
-  'limit' to only return the first items
-  'offset' to skip items
-  'sort' to sort items according to
