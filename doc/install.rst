Running Server
--------------

To run a local copy that will use the local filesystem as a storage area, do the following:

* cd test-data
* sudo ../rocket-skates

NOTE: I need the sudo to bind the tftp port.  This is configurable, i.e.  *--tftp-port=30000*  

The following pieces endpoints are available:

* https://127.0.0.1:8092/swagger-ui - swagger-ui to explore the API
* https://127.0.0.1:8092/swagger.json - API Swagger JSON file
* https://127.0.0.1:8092/api/v3 - Raw api endpoint
* https://127.0.0.1:8091 - Static files served from the test-data/tftpboot directory
* udp 69 or *--tftp-port* - Static files served from the test-data/tftpboot directory through the tftp protocol
* udp 68 - DHCP Server listening socket - will only server addresses when once configured.  By default, silent.

*NOTE* Sometimes the cert/key pair in the github tree is corrupt or not sufficient for the environment.  You can run
the following command to rebuild a local cert/key pair.  You may need to install the openssl tools.

* openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes
