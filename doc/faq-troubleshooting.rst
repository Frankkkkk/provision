FAQ / Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section is designed to answer frequently asked questions and help troubleshoot Digital Rebar Provision installs.

.. _rs_bind_error:

Bind Error
----------

Digital Rebar Provision will fail if it cannot attach to one of the required ports.

* Typical Error Message: "listen udp4 :67: bind: address already in use"
* Additional Information: The conflicted port will be included in the error between colons (e.g.: `:67:`)
* Workaround: If the conflicting service is not required, simply disable that service
* Resolution: Stop the offending service on the system.  Typical corrective actions are:

  * 67 - dhcp.  Correct with `sudo pkill dnsmasq`

See the port mapping list on start-up for a complete list.

.. _rs_gen_cert:

Generate Certificate
--------------------

Sometimes the cert/key pair in the github tree is corrupt or not sufficient for the environment.  The following command can be used to rebuild a local cert/key pair.

  ::

    sudo openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes


It may be necessary to install the openssl tools.

Turn Up the Debug
-----------------

To get additional debug from dr-provision, set debug preferences to increase the logging.  See :ref:`rs_model_prefs`.

Rocket Skates?
--------------

Rocket Skates was the working name for Digital Rebar Provision during initial development.  Since they are fast and powerful boots, it seemed like a natural name for a Cobbler replacement.
